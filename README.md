# Automated Pricing Data Retrieval for Parts

## Overview
This project emerged as a pivotal initiative during an internship at Bose, dedicated to advancing supply chain optimization through an automated, Python-based solution. The primary goal was to simplify the process of comparing part prices from internal data with those found on external websites. The project harnessed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to automate web scraping, using an internal file as a reference. Additionally, the project incorporated features to communicate the results via SMTP using Python modules.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Windows
- Edge Browser
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver
